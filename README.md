<h2>How to install</h2>
This application is written in Java, so in theory it should run on any platform as long as Java is installed.

1. Make sure Java 1.8 or newer is installed on your system.<br>
This can be downloaded directly from Oracle using the following link: https://www.java.com/en/download/

2. Download the XB4K.jar file. This file contains the entire application. No installation is required, simply run the file as a standard executable. This usually means double clicking the file if you are running windows.<br>
On Linux you can use the following command: java -jar XB4K.jar
